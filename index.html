										<p>Video games are a big part of my life, I have grown up playing them and see no signs of stopping. 
											I created my first game following a YouTube tutorial and it was a very basic game but I could tell
											that it really grabbed my attention and I wanted to learn more. I went back to school at Full Sail University
											and wasn't really sure my end goals but I knew I wanted to write code. I started working torwards a bacholers degree
											in Video Game development and eventually decided to move to Computer Science. I have worked on projects from video
											games to mobile apps on Android and I am continuing to learn more skills as I work. If for some reason I'm not playing
											games or working I'm probably fishing or out at the golf course.</p>
