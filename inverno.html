								<p> Inverno is about a child who is on winter break but spring is around the corner, and the heat is coming to melt away the snow and send the kids back 
									to school. In this game, you play as the child who is using their imagination to see themselves as a mage with snow-like powers. Using their ice
									daggers, snowballs, and winter storms, the player will fight back against the inferno monsters coming to melt away all the snow. The enemies are 
									assigned to attack snowmen stationed around the world. The player's job is to destroy the enemies before they destroy all the snowmen on the map 
									or kill the player.
								</p>
								<h2> Responsibilities</h2>
								<ul> 
									<li>Designed UI assets and added SFX and music.</li>
									<li>Play tested game and debugged code using white box testing.</li>
									<li>Customized player prefab and solved player prefab model issues.</li>
									<li>Adjusted animations for player model and enemy models with different movement states.</li>
									<li>Added an ice dagger ability to the player and customized animations to fit with each attack method.</li>
								</ul>
								<h2>Animations</h2>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/InvernoAnims.gif"   width="100%" alt="" /></span>
								<p> I took on the role of creating the animations for all the models in the game. We wanted the game to feel like a fast-paced action game so, our animations
									needed to match that. I started with basic walking and running animations and slowly worked towards adding more advanced animations like jumping and dodging.
									The next step was to work on the attack animations and adding animations for the different abilities like double jumps and dash ability.
								</p>

								<h2>Player</h2>
								<p> I worked on timing the animations for landing and jumping so that when the player hits the jump buttons, the animations transition smoothly from one to the next. 
									I also programmed that when a certain button is pushed, a corresponding animation will play. For the attacks, I repeated the same method. However, within these animations, 
									once the animation got to a certain frame, the animation would call a method that would spawn whatever attack was happening so that it would occur at the correct time.
								</p>

								<h2>Enemies</h2>
								<p>Lastly, I worked on the enemy movement and animations. The base objective is to find the snow closest to the enemies and attack it. I programmed it to where
									the snow locations were compiled into a list. The enemy then finds the snow in the list that is closest and moves towards it. If the player
									gets close enough, then the enemy turns to attack the player. I created three different enemy types: small, medium, and large. They have various
									movement speeds and attack distances, which makes them a little bit more dynamic. These enemies have a cone of vision, and if the player is within a certain
									distance and inside their cone of vision, the enemies will move towards the player and start to attack them.
